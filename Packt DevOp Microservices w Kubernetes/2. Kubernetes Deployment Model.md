# Kubernetes Deployment Model
## Using **_ReplicaSets_**
### Labels
Label all the Things  
You can use labels to query and filter objedts:

    kubectl get pods -l app=my-microservice

### Defining a ReplicaSet
ReplicaSet **Properties**
- Pod template  
  Definition for Pods that are managed by this ReplicaSet
- Replica count  
  Defines how many instances should be running at any time
- Label selector  
  Determines which Pods are managed by this ReplicaSet

ReplicaSet Example:  
File: _my-service_replicaset.yml_

    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: ReplicaSet
    metadata:
      name: my-service
    spec:
      replicas: 3
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: my-service
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: my-service
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: service
            image: nginx

The `selector` labels must match the Pod metadata labels

Create the ReplicaSet

    kubectl apply -f my-service_replicaset.yml
    kubectl scale replicaset my-service --replicas=8
    kubectl delete -f my-service_replicaset.yml
    
## Pod Networking
### Pods
- Each Pod gets its own IP address  
- These are routed w/in the Cluster only - no external connectivity  
- Pods are short-lived  
- Addresses may change frequently  
- No DNS for Pod IPs  
- No Load balancing  

### Services
- Provide one stable IP and DNS name for connection to a group of Pods
- Selects a group of Pods by _label_
- Round-robin load balancing

Types of network Services
- ClusterIP
  - Stable IP and DNS for internal use by the _Cluster_
- NodePort
  - ClusterIP plus:
  - Each _Node_ get a public TCP port, forwarding to that service
- LoadBalancer
  - NodePort plus:
  - A load balancer is created to allow external incoming traffic
    - Only with a Cloud Provider??

## Defining a Service
File: _service.yml_

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: my-service
    spec:
      type: ClusterIP
      selector:
        app: my-service
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 80
          targetPort: 80

The _Service name_ will be used as the DNS name

    my-service.default.svc.cluster.local

## HTTP Connectivity with `Ingress`
- Defines request routing for HTTP requests to services  
- Works at the _application_ layer
- Supports _path_ and _host-based_ routing, caching, auth, and more

File: _my-ingress.yml_

    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: my-ingress
    spec:
      rules:
      - host: your-app.example
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /shop
            backend:
              serviceName: my-service
              servicePOrt: 80
          - path: /home
            backend:
              serviceName: my-other-service
              servicePort: 80

Create

    kubectl apply -f my-ingress.yml

### Other `Ingress` features
- TLS Offloading
- Rate Limiting
- Authentication

## Deployments: Managing the Application Lifecycle 
Update your deployment w/out down time

### ReplicaSet Limitations
If you update the ReplicaSet definition e.g. a new image, it will not automatically update the existing containers.  
You must manually delete them and let the ReplicaSet create new containers w the new image.  

### Deployment: Rollout update w/out down time
A Deployment will create a new ReplicaSet to deploy the new _spec_  
It will methodically scale down the old ReplicaSet and scale up the new.  

Deployment Example: Looks just like a ReplicaSet!  
File: _my-deployment.yml_  

    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: my-service
    spec:
      replicas: 3
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: my-service
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: my-service
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: service
            image: nginx:1.13.11

Create the deployment

    kubectl apply -f my-deployment.yml
    kubectl get replicasets
    kubectl get pods
    kubectl edit deployment my-deployment
    kubectl rollout undo deployment/my-deployment
