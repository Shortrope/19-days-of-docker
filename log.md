## Day 1: August 13, 2018 - 2hr

**Today's Progress**:  
Finished Chap 6: Binding ports and IP addresses

**Thoughts:**  
Things are coming to gether now that I can connect to a service in a container

## Day 2: August 14, 2018 - 1hr

**Today's Progress**:  
First section of chap 7 Volumes
Could see where persistant volumes are stored and that they are not deleted automaticaly with the
container... This means they could be orphaned (like temp files growing)

**Thoughts:**  
Little tougher to start today. Tired from busy work day, but first pomodoro went by quickly.
