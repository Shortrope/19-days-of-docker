# To Do
## Inspect: what are the important sections
- Image
- Container
- Volume

Is it worth using `--format=` vs just inspecting w `less`?

## Networking
IP addresses
Ports

## Volumes
Mount host directory  
Mount a created volume  
Mount a containers volume  
Why use a data container vs a created volume?  
Share a volume among several containers
